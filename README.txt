# Categorization Model with REGEX

This repository contains a Python-based solution for categorizing products using regex pattern matching and data from Jupyter Notebooks. The project includes data preprocessing, regex model generation, and categorization validation.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to set up a Python environment and install necessary packages.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

You can install the required packages using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start working with the Jupyter Notebooks:

1. Activate your Python environment.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

`jupyter notebook`


3. Open the notebook files (`*.ipynb`) in the repository.
4. 

## Data

The project uses the following datasets:

- `data/pm_result_cosmetics.csv` - Primary data including product names and breadcrumbs.
- `data/regex_model_cosmetics_full.csv` - Regex patterns for categorization.
- `data/training_dataset_cosmetics.csv` - Dataset for training and validation.
